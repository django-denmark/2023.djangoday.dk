## Individual tickets + Late Bird

You can also be a corporate supporter w/ tickets. See below.


**Venue tickets** include:

* A breakfast, lunch and cake
* Hanging out with your favorite Django people in one convenient location
* Networking drinks afterwards
* Free optional membership of Django Denmark
* Stickers and merch
* **All prices include 25% VAT and exclude service fees**

**Late bird:** We're selling a few more tickets - ordering a ticket late means that we can't process any food requests, but you are still more than welcome and can bring your own food (or buy something near-by).

When ordering tickets, you will be asked questions about dietary preferences and
if you want to be a member of Django Denmark, our association behind Django Day.
All of this is with no additional costs.
