Djangonauts from in and around Denmark are meeting up for the third edition of Django Day, to be held April 14th 2023.
It will be a full day of talks, followed by an evening of social events.

Come and meet your local and excellent community and share with them. Tell us about your idea and your contribution to make
this a great day.

The event will accommodate 50-100 people physically and be streamed live and recorded for additionally larger audiences. If the ticket sales allow us, we will relocate to a larger physical venue.

First time doing a talk? We want you to submit! It is very understandable and encouraged to ask questions when preparing your
talk, please don’t hesitate to write cfp@django-denmark.org.
