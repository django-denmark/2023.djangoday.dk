# Program

Django Day is a full day of talks, all connected to modern issues faced
by Django developers of all experiences. It's a single-track
event, meaning that you won't have to miss anything. The day will end
with a round of **lightning talks**, which can be submitted on the day of the event,
and be drawn during the day.

**UPDATE 2022-03-30** The schedule is now visible below, subject to any changes that might occur. Please refer to this very page for any changes.

gathering.
