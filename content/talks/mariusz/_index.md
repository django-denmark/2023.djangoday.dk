The migration framework has been a part of Django since version 1.7.
That's been 8 year now, however it still has powerful abilities that
are not widely used and well known.

This talk will discuss how we can use migrations' secret powers in response to
changing business requirements, and how to create less complicated and more robust
migrations with less downtime.
