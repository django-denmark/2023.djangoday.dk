A lot of material is out there to ensure that "style" is maintained for "non test" code. But what is "style"? And why do we need a "style" guide? And why would we need a style guide for our tests code? Explain to me with examples please.

## About Joseph

I’m Joseph. Or “Joe” in short. I am in software engineering since the ‘00s. Working professionally since ‘06.

Most of the time my roles were “backend”. Where working with data and relational databases is a key part of backend.

From ‘08 onwards I worked a lot with Python. And the framework I worked with most is Django.
