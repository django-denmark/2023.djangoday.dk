Django is one of the longest running open source web frameworks but
despite this it is still one of the best around and continues to be
actively developed.

Approaching such software can be intimidating to a novice developer as
well as an experienced one because it is the result of over 15 years
of excellent developers work and it would take a long time to get to
know it thoroughly.

In this talk we will see together the way I found for anyone to take
full advantage of Django while contributing to its success and that of
its community.
