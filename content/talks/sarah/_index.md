Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sarah Boyce! I've been a Django Python developer for 4+ years. I'm part of Django's Review and Triage team, I write the weekly Django development updates on [Django News](https://django-news.com/), co-organiser of the [Django Cologne meetup](https://www.meetup.com/koln-django-meetup-gruppe/) and co-organiser of a new program - [Djangonaut Space](https://djangonaut.space/).
Outside of all things Django, I love to play badminton and paint!
