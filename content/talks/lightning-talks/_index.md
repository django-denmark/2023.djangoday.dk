⚡⚡⚡ Announcing streaming/remote 5 minute lightning talks at Django Day Copenhagen ⚡⚡⚡

Lightning talks:

* With or without slides
* Almost any topic you want
* New speakers encouraged.

The lightning talks are scheduled to take place 17:30 (but keep an eye out for changes in the schedule), at the end of Django Day on Friday April 8th. You need to [register](/tickets/) for the event.

Live talks at the venue: Announce your talk to an organizer before the end of the lunch break.

Remote participants: It's a **maximum 5 minutes**. The 5 minutes are absolutely non-negotiable, as we cannot upload longer clips to the streaming platform. **Send a youtube link or file to info@django-denmark.org before Thursday 20:00 UTC+2.**. The talk will be reviewed.

#### How to record

Online tools: Create a meeting with yourself on Google Meet, Zoom or [JitSi](https://meet.jit.si/) and record the meeting. This way, you can record yourself through a headset and for instance share your screen.

Software for Gnome on Linux: The program [EasyScreenCast](https://github.com/EasyScreenCast/EasyScreenCast) makes it possible to capture your screen, webcam and sound at the same time. You can select which area of the screen you want to record.
