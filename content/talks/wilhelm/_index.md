There's one thing I enjoy least about software development: Writing tests. I appreciate the tests I've written in the past, but I do not enjoy the process of creating new ones. How can we make test writing a pleasant, brief, and fun experience? This talk shares a novel approach of deterministically generating working integration tests from traces recorded using kolo. This cuts down on the time it takes to write tests overall and reduces the often painful experience of setting up fixtures, test data, and database state.
